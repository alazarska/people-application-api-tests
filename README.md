# People application - REST API tests

REST API tests with HttpClient

Tested application: https://github.com/alazarska/people-application

## Configuration

| Property         | Description                                                                     |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| application.url  | URL to application.                                                             |

Properties can be set in two ways:

1. Through config.properties file. (e.g. `application.url`)
2. Through environment variables, where property name is written with upper
   case separated by underscore. (e.g. `APPLICATION_URL`)
